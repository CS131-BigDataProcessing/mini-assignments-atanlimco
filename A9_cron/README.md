The files included in the folder are my_crontab.EpVKd8, about_crontask.txt, and the README.md file.
The “my_crontab.EpVKd8” file is a copy of my crontab. It contains the three tasks: Daily File Cleanup, Weekly System Backup, and Usage Report Email. The Daily File Cleanup task clears the contents of a folder called “temp_folder” every day at 2AM. The Weekly System Backup task uses “tar” to zip my home directory and saves it as “my_backup.tar.gz” located in a “backups” folder every Sunday at 3AM. The Usage Report Email sends an email containing the disk usage report to my school email everyday at 8:30AM.
The “about_crontask.txt” file contains the answers to the two questions.
